#Codebreaker

Codebreaker is a version of a puzzle game also known as Cows & Bulls, Bulls & Cows, Mastermind, and several other names, depending on where you're from. In this version it's played with four-letter words with no repeating letters (see word bank below), but in other iterations it's also been played with four-digit numbers.
